# schedule
A simple repo to create a static webpage for my schedule to be accessible from any device. It also contains links to a plethora of resources some of which belongs to me and my colleagues made available for you all. Needless to say it's pretty much all a CSE student needs in his 4 years of course. If you have any content of value feel free to nudge me so that I add it here.
